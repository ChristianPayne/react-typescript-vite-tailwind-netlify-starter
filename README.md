# React, Typescript, Netlify, Vite, TailwindCSS Starter
## What is it:
This is a basic working dev environment for working on a React/Typescript application, including TailwindCSS, and using _next generation tooling_ from Vite. In addition running lambda's from Netlify/Typescript in the same environment.

## Logging:
I like seeing typescript errors in my console, as well as using VS Code, or any other modern text editor, so we run tsc concurrently with vite and it's HMR. The output then looks something like this:
```bash
[‚ö°Ô∏èvite]   ready in 238ms.
[üëπtsc] 4:42:46 PM - Found 0 errors. Watching for file changes.
```
